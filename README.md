# Hi I'm MiklÃ³s ðŸ‘‹
(pronounced in English Micklo**sh**, en franÃ§ais Miqulo**sch**).

Are you looking for a skilled front-end web developer, type designer, and graphic designer? Look no further! Let me introduce myself.

I am a self-motivated learner who has completed several bootcamps in different programming languages, including **Ruby**, **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **Node JS**, and **React**. Through these bootcamps, work experience and my own self-study, I have honed my skills in web development and design.

I always start with design using **Figma**, and then I move on to coding. I am capable of creating fully functional web applications that are both visually appealing and user-friendly. I am constantly learning and improving my skills, and I am always open to new opportunities.

Aside from web development and design, I have a passion for creating new typefaces. I love to bring my creative ideas to life through my work.

If you're looking for a friendly, skilled, and hard-working developer and designer, then don't hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to share more about my experience and how I can help bring your vision to life. Let's work together to create something amazing! ðŸ˜Š
