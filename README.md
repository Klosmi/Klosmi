# Hi I'm MiklÃ³s ðŸ‘‹
(pronounced in English Micklo**sh**, en franÃ§ais Miqulo**sch**).

As a versatile professional skilled in Design System, UI/UX, and front-end coding (JavaScript, PHP, HTML, SASS), I bring a well-rounded expertise to the table. With a self-motivated approach, I continuously learn and excel in design, programming, and Figma. Typeface design is not only my passion but also a driving force behind bringing creative ideas to life. If you're looking for a friendly, skilled, and hard-working designer, let's connect and embark on the journey of creating something amazing together! ðŸ˜Š
