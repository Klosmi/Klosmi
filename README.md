# Hi I'm Miklós 👋
(pronounced *mikloːʃ* in Hungarian, which is in English something like Meek-**lohsh**, and in French something like Miqulo**sh**).

As a versatile professional skilled in Typography and Font Engineering, Design System, UI/UX, and front-end coding (JavaScript, PHP, HTML, SASS), I bring a well-rounded expertise to the table. With a self-motivated approach, I continuously learn and excel in design, programming, and Figma.    
Typeface design is not only my passion but also a driving force behind bringing creative ideas to life. Let's connect to create something really cool together! 😊
